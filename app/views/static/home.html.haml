  This site is designed teach about and support citizen scientists
  interested in Enviornmental and Ecological Science and exploring
  long-term species and environmental changes at various elevations
  (including less studied alpine environments).

    Our Activities
  %br
  Bi-annually, we
  %strong survey
  species distribution along a
  %strong transect
  %em (a fixed series of plots along line)
  that changes signifigantly in
  %strong elevation.
  %br
  This study will be done for many years to come -- allowing comparisons over
  long-time spans.  Studies done over long periods in order to watch for
  time-based changes are known as
  %strong longitudinal studies.
